# Fox_todo_list
A Python to-do list with some basic functionality - it can save, load, open in detail view, order by creation date, etc. Initially an experiment to get used to Tkinter, the functionality was expanded so it could be something I'd actually like to use.

# Bear in mind
- Created with Python 3 (specifically on two different systems, using Python 3.8 and 3.9)
- Created on a Windows system, untested on other systems.
- Functions for loading/saving work by creating and modifying a text file in the same directory as the script is called from.
- This could be reworked or the "save file" hidden but for my purposes being able to go in and edit an actual text file is a boon, not a problem to fix.
- The save file and image logo need to be in the same location as the script is called from. Bear this in mind if you're opening it via something else (i.e. another script)
